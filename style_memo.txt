**Note on formatting style for vortexR**

Most of the code is formatted following Google's R Style Guide. 
However, some parts have been then re-formatted following Hadley's style suggestions from his book:
r-packages. The latter re-formatting mainly concerns functions and arguments' names.

Below, there is a summary to keep the style consistent within vortexR. 

Use only lower cases and underscore "_" for exported functions' and arguments' 
names (no CamelCases or dots ".").

CamelCases and dots "." are OK in the code.

Keep a space around operators except with "=" for functions' arguments.

"if" statements only go in one line IF there is one command only (and with curly 
brackets) otherwise split them over multiple lines.

No full stop in the title and arguments' descriptions (within roxygen's comments) yes in all the rest.
